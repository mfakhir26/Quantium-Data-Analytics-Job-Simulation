# Trial Store Performance & Customer Segmentation Analysis

This project evaluates the effectiveness of a retail trial across selected stores by analyzing customer behavior and sales performance. In addition to assessing the overall impact of the trial, we explore how different **customer segments** responded to the changes, focusing on **purchase behavior by segment** and **product category performance** (especially chips).

## Project Overview

* **Objective:**
  Evaluate whether trial interventions in Stores 77, 86, and 88 led to improved performance metrics and how different **customer segments** responded during the trial.

* **Trial Period:**
  February 2019 â€“ April 2019

* **Approach:**

  * Identify a comparable control store for each trial store using **correlation and magnitude-based similarity** on pre-trial metrics.
  * Compare key metrics such as **total sales**, **number of customers**, and between trial and control stores.
  * Segment customers based on lifecycle and purchase behavior.
  * Analyze trial impact **within customer segments**, highlighting which groups drove performance.

* **Key Outcome:**
  The trial resulted in a measurable and statistically significant increase in performance, especially among **mainstream young singles/couples** who showed the strongest response in the **chips category**.

## Tools & Technologies

* **Languages & Libraries:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy)
* **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook
* **Other Tools:** Microsoft Excel (for data summary and visualization), PowerPoint (for reporting)

## Customer Segmentation

Customer segmentation was performed using demographic and behavioral variables. Key segments include:

* **Mainstream Young Singles/Couples**
* **Midage and Older Families**
* **Young Families**
* **Older Singles/Couples**
* Others based on lifecycle and lifestage groups

For each segment, we tracked:

* Frequency of purchase
* Product category preferences
* Response to trial interventions
* Contribution to overall sales lift

## Key Features

* Automated control store selection using similarity scores
* Visualization of trends over time by trial/control and customer segment
* Statistical significance testing of trial impact (t-tests)
* Segment-wise analysis of **category lift**, with focus on **Chips**, **Soft Drinks**, etc.
* Presentation-ready outputs with graphs and insights

## Summary of Results

* **Sales Impact:**
  All three trial stores showed improved sales and customer metrics vs. control.

* **Segment Insights:**

  * **Mainstream Young Singles/Couples** responded most positively to the trial.
  * Segments like **Older Singles/Couples** showed a moderate change.
  * Clear increase in **Chips category purchases**, especially among responsive segments.

* **Statistical Significance:**
  Trial impacts were statistically significant in most cases (p < 0.05), particularly in stores 77 and 88.
